# Accurate Geometrical Efficiency Calculator (GeoEfficiency)

The Package `GeoEfficiency`, an officially registered Julia program, provides a set of tools  to calculate the geometrical efficiency in a fast and accurate way. 
The Package models a radiation detector irradiated by a radiative source. 
The Package relay directly on numerical evaluation of closed form analytical formula describing the geometrical efficiency.

## The following list show the current and planed features:-

 - [x] support of widely used detector geometries.
      - [x] `cylinder` detectors.
      - [x] `bore-hole` detectors.
      - [x] `well-type` detectors.
	
 - [ ] support of specialized detector geometries.
 
 - [x] support of isotropic radioactive sources.
      - [x] `point` sources.
      - [x] `disc` sources.
      - [x] `cylinder` sources.

 - [ ] support of anisotropic radioactive sources.
      - [ ] `point` sources.
	
 - [ ] consider more details of the measurement setup.
      - [ ] the detector effect.
      - [ ] the end cap effect.
      - [ ] the medium and absorber effect.
      
 - [ ] combine the effect of the source geometry and composition. 


## Requirements
 *  Julia 0.6 (current) or above.
 *  QuadGK 0.1.2 or above, will be installed automatically during the package Installation.
 *  Compat 0.63.0 or above, will be installed automatically during the package Installation.
 
## Download and Install the Package
The package is registered in an officially METADATA.jl and so can be installed through the Julia package system by running 

```julia
julia> Pkg.add("GeoEfficiency") 
```

## Quick Usage
```julia
julia> using GeoEfficiency
julia> calc()
```
**see also: `geoEff()`, `calcN()`, `batch()`**
	

## Package Overview
The following constructor can be used to construct a specific type of detector 
 *  `CylDetector` for cylindrical detector, 
 *  `BoreDetector` for bore hole, 
 *  `WellDetector` for well type detector.

 While the function `Detector` can be used to construct any of the above types. You may try also `getDetectors`.


`Point` constructor is used to construct an anchoring point of a source relative to it its position to the detector is specified.
For a point source, the anchoring point is the source itself. 
The `source()` method take input from the `console` and return a tuple describing the source.


The efficiency calculation can be done by one of the functions: 
*  `geoEff` used with or without argument(s), 
*  `calc` ask for the required information from the `console`, 
*  `calcN` just a repeat of the `calc` function 
*  batch() which try to take required information from csv files located in 
   the home directory inside a folder called `GeoEfficiency`.
 
For more on the function and its methods prefix the name of the function by `?`.

## note
**Input from the `console` can be numerical expression not just a number.**
   
   > **5/2, 5//2, pi, exp(2) , 1E-2, 5.2/3, sin(1), pi/2/3**
   > **All are valid expressions.**
	
## Batch Calculation
The package can be used to perform batch calculations by calling one of the 
methods of the function `batch`. The output results of batch calculations is 
found by default in `GeoEfficiency\results` folder inside the user home.

**For example	`c:\users\yourusername\GeoEfficiency\results\`**.

The function `batch()` can be called with or without arrangement(s). 
The without argument version relay on previously prepared Comma Saved  Values 
[CSV] files, that can be easily edit by Microsoft Excel, located by default 
in the ``GeoEfficiency`` folder.

Those Comma Saved  Values [CSV] files are:-
	
*  ``Detectors.csv`` contains the detectors description; The line format is: 
	
		 Crystal_Radius | Crystal_Length | Hole_Radius | Hole_Depth |
    	 ---------------| ---------------|-------------|----------- |

*  ``srcHeights.csv`` contains the source heights; 
	
    	 Source_Heights | 
		 ---------------|

*  ``srcRhos.csv`` contains the source off-axis distances; 	 				
	
		 Source_Rhos | 
     	 ------------|

*  ``srcRadii.csv`` contains the source radii for disc and cylindrical sources; 			
	
		 Source_Radii| 
		 ------------|

*  ``srcLengths.csv`` contains the source length for cylindrical sources; 	
	
		 Source_Lengths| 
		 --------------|


## note
**for Comma Saved Values [CSV] files each line represent an entry, the first line is always treated as the header.**
	 
## warning
**the program expect each line to contain one number for all CSV files except for ``Detectors.csv`` each line should contain at least one number or at most four separated numbers.**
